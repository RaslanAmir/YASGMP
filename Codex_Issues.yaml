    .NET SDK 9.0.100 is now installed in the container, but the Windows 10 SDK 19041+ and MAUI workloads are still missing.
    Restore/build/test for Windows-targeted projects fail with NETSDK1100/NETSDK1147 and the WPF build hits unresolved YasGMP.Helpers/Diagnostics references and signature DTO types.
    Use a Windows host with the Windows desktop SDK/workloads to unblock the release build/test cadence.

  suggested_fix: |
    Install the Windows 10 SDK (19041+) and required MAUI workloads on a Windows environment, then rerun `dotnet restore`, `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -c Release -p:EnableWindowsTargeting=true`, and `dotnet test YasGMP.Wpf.Tests --filter DockLayoutPersistenceServiceTests`.

    Produce the per-folder inventory and entity traceability map during Increment 2, aligning Views/ViewModels/Services/DB artifacts.

  severity: "⚠️ Medium"
  description: |
    Increment 2 documentation outlines the AuditEnvelopeHash model and AppendAuditHashAsync workflow, but the DatabaseService extensions,
    signature manifest updates, and verification routines remain unimplemented.
    Implement the outlined hash-chain persistence and expose verification cues in the inspector/status bar once SDK validation is possible.

    - docs/codex_plan.md

  suggested_fix: |
    Add the AuditEnvelopeHash storage schema, extend DatabaseService with AppendAuditHashAsync, update IElectronicSignatureDialogService consumers
    to include hash metadata, and surface the resulting tokens through relevant view-models and dashboards.

    AssetsModuleView now binds localized ToolTip/Automation metadata for search, grid, and editor controls.
    Accessibility inspector validation remains pending because the Windows-specific tooling is unavailable inside the Linux container.

    Re-run the Windows Accessibility Insights or FlaUI-based automation suite on a Windows host to confirm each control exposes the expected tooltip,
    AutomationName, and AutomationId metadata once the dotnet CLI and desktop tooling are available.

    AssetsModuleViewModel now sources status messages from ShellStrings, but build/test execution is blocked by the missing dotnet CLI.

    Once the Windows build environment is restored, run the WPF shell and associated tests to confirm localized status strings refresh at runtime,
    covering both English and Croatian resource dictionaries for the Assets module.
