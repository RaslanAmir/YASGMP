    .NET SDK 9.0.100 is now installed in the container, but the Windows 10 SDK 19041+ and MAUI workloads are still missing.
    Restore/build/test for Windows-targeted projects fail with NETSDK1100/NETSDK1147 and the WPF build hits unresolved YasGMP.Helpers/Diagnostics references and signature DTO types.
    Use a Windows host with the Windows desktop SDK/workloads to unblock the release build/test cadence.

  suggested_fix: |
    Install the Windows 10 SDK (19041+) and required MAUI workloads on a Windows environment, then rerun `dotnet restore`, `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -c Release -p:EnableWindowsTargeting=true`, and `dotnet test YasGMP.Wpf.Tests --filter DockLayoutPersistenceServiceTests`.
