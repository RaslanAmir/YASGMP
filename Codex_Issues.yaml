  type: BuildEnv
  severity: "‚ùå High"
  description: |
    The execution environment lacks the dotnet CLI, preventing restore/build/test workflows for the WPF and MAUI projects. This blocks compliance validation, smoke automation, and .NET 9 targeting enforcement.

    - docs/codex_progress.json
  suggested_fix: |
    Install the .NET 9 SDK (9.0.100) and Windows 10 SDK 19041+ on the host or container. Re-run dotnet --info, dotnet restore, and dotnet build for yasgmp.sln and YasGMP.Wpf once available.
