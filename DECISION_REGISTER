  decision: Rebaseline environment as .NET 9 ready and schedule AppCore diagnostics partitioning before further WPF module work.
  impact: Ensures planning artifacts reflect current build blockers so remediation batches can focus on segregating MAUI-only dependencies.

  decision: Use Xceed/AvalonDock XML schema namespace (http://schemas.xceed.com/wpf/xaml/avalondock) instead of CLR namespaces in XAML for DockingManager and Layout types.
  impact: Aligns with guardrails, reduces MC3074 designer warnings, and unifies XAML across views.

  decision: Introduce runtime-loaded WPF ResourceDictionaries (Strings.en.xaml, Strings.hr.xaml) for EN↔HR and bind shell UI via DynamicResource.
  impact: Establishes i18n foundation with minimal intrusion; enables incremental migration of strings across modules while keeping MAUI unaffected.

  decision: Localize ModuleRegistry metadata via resource keys and bind Ribbon/Backstage labels using DynamicResource; add AutomationProperties.Name across shell and module views.
  impact: Enables EN↔HR switching without code changes and improves accessibility/smoke harness stability with deterministic automation names.

  decision: Extend StatusBar with UTC clock, Env, Server, DB, User and smoke status; localize labels (EN↔HR) and add a11y names.
  impact: Meets SAP-B1 parity for status surface and supports smoke visibility without modal prompts; zero impact on MAUI.

  decision: Propagate toolbar i18n converter pattern (CaptionKey/ToolTipKey/AutomationNameKey via ResourceStringConverter) to module views and strengthen a11y bindings; extend smoke harness to exercise CFL and Golden Arrow flows.
  impact: Consistent EN↔HR captions/tooltips across toolbars; stable AutomationProperties for FlaUI/UIA and screen readers; early verification of navigation/picker flows without coupling to DB.
