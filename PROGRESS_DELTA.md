- Module Environment: blocked → blocked | Reasons: dotnet CLI still unavailable; static documentation refreshed | Issues closed: []

- Increment 1 Planning: new → drafted | Reasons: Created compliance backlog (inventory, traceability, audit hash-chain) pending execution once CLI available | Issues closed: []
- Increment 2 Planning: drafted → documented | Reasons: Added per-folder/module inventory table, initial entity traceability map, and audit/signature hash-chain outline in docs/codex_plan.md | Issues closed: [I-002]
