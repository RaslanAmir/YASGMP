# Project Overview

YasGMP centralizes GMP-compliant manufacturing maintenance, calibration, and quality workflows across the MAUI client, shared services, and diagnostics tooling.

# Current Status

- Merge the change control assignment UI, workflow, and QA checklist pull requests (PRs #26, #28, #29).
- Verify the calibration self-referencing EF mappings provided in PR #53 before release.

# Blockers

No active blockers.

# Next Steps

- Exercise the new change control diagnostics harness once the open PRs land.
- Run an end-to-end build after the EF mapping fixes merge.
