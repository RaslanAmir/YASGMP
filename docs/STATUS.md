# Project Overview

YasGMP centralizes GMP-compliant manufacturing maintenance, calibration, and quality workflows. The application spans the MAUI client, shared services, and diagnostics tooling that keep change control, audit trail, and validation data consistent across platforms.

# Current Status

- Complete automation around schema diff regression reports.
- Close UI gaps between MAUI work order flows and the expanded data models.

# Blockers

- QA sign-off on the change-control replay harness is still pending.

# Next Steps

- Backfill calibration certificate seed data after the schema migration.
- Schedule Android smoke testing once attachment sync stabilizes.
