# Codex Plan — WPF Shell & Full Integration

## Current Compile Status
- [x] Dotnet SDKs detected and recorded *(dotnet-install.sh installed SDK 9.0.305 — previously 9.0.100; `dotnet --info` captured 2025-10-10 on linux-x64. Windows desktop workloads still require Windows 10 SDK 19041+ and workloads to build.)*
  - 2025-10-13T10:58Z: `dotnet --info` retried after retargeting MAUI/AppCore to .NET 9; command still returns `bash: command not found: dotnet` so validation remains Windows-host only.
  - 2025-10-10T11:26Z: `bash dotnet-install.sh -c 9.0 --install-dir ~/.dotnet` reprovisioned SDK 9.0.305. `dotnet --info` confirms the toolchain, but Windows 10 SDK 19041+ cannot be installed inside this Linux container.
  - 2025-10-10T10:05Z: dotnet-install.sh reprovisioned SDK 9.0.305 via `./dotnet-install.sh --channel 9.0`; `dotnet --info` confirms the toolchain but Windows 10 SDK/workloads cannot be installed inside the Linux container.
  - 2025-10-10T06:38Z: dotnet-install.sh provisioned SDK 9.0.100 and `dotnet --info` now reports the toolchain on linux-x64; Windows 10 SDK/workloads still missing so Windows-targeted restore/build/test must run on a Windows host.
  - 2025-10-07T11:06Z: Current container session again reports `bash: command not found: dotnet`; document cadence remained static-analysis only until SDK was provisioned.
  - 2026-02-09T09:42Z: `dotnet --version` retried for this batch; container still returns `bash: command not found: dotnet`.
  - 2026-02-20T08:57Z: `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln` retried post-inspector automation updates; container still reports `bash: command not found: dotnet`.
  - 2026-03-24T09:15Z: `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln` retried after updating Assets navigation regression tests; container still reports `bash: command not found: dotnet`.
  - 2026-03-25T08:40Z: `dotnet --version` retried while tightening B1FormDocumentViewModel command refresh hooks; container again responds `bash: command not found: dotnet`.
  - 2026-04-04T09:10Z: `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln` retried after Assets drill-down updates; container still returns `bash: command not found: dotnet`.
- 2026-04-07T09:20Z: `dotnet --version` retried ahead of the Assets status localization batch; command still returns `bash: command not found: dotnet`, so env_guard remains static-analysis.
- 2026-04-09T00:00Z: `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln` and `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows` remain blocked with `bash: command not found: dotnet` after introducing WPF adapters for shared code/QR utilities; Windows host validation is still required.
- 2026-04-10T09:45Z: `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln` retried during the Assets module service injection batch; container still returns `bash: command not found: dotnet`, so validation remains Windows-host only.
  - 2026-04-11T09:20Z: `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln` rerun while migrating Assets to the shared view-model service; CLI remains unavailable (`bash: command not found: dotnet`).
- 2026-04-11T00:00Z: `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build yasgmp.csproj -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0`, and `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows` retried after wiring WPF asset editor QR fields; each command still fails with `bash: command not found: dotnet` until a Windows host is available.
- 2026-04-12T09:05Z: `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln` rerun while landing scheduling adapter regression tests; CLI remains unavailable (`bash: command not found: dotnet`), so validation stays pending on Windows.

- 2026-05-07T09:10Z: `dotnet --version`, `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build yasgmp.csproj -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0`, and `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows` retried while documenting external servicer oversight; all continue to fail with `bash: command not found: dotnet` so smoke automation remains blocked on Windows tooling.
  - 2025-10-16T09:40Z: `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln` retried during Work Orders signature metadata wiring; environment still returns `bash: command not found: dotnet` so validation stays Windows-host only.
- [ ] Solution restores *(blocked on Windows-targeting prerequisites; historical attempts below hit missing CLI and the latest 2025-10-10 runs failed with NETSDK1100/NETSDK1147 because Windows 10 SDK and MAUI workloads are absent on linux.)*
  - 2025-10-13T10:59Z: `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln` retried post-retarget; CLI still missing so the command exits with `bash: command not found: dotnet`.
  - 2025-10-10T11:24Z: `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln` (with `EnableWindowsTargeting=true`) fails with NETSDK1147 because the maui-tizen workload is unavailable on Linux; full solution restore remains Windows-host only.
  - 2025-10-10T10:07Z: `dotnet restore -p:EnableWindowsTargeting=true` exits with NETSDK1147 (maui-tizen workload) after `dotnet workload install maui` reports the workload is unsupported on Linux.
  - 2025-10-10T06:40Z: `dotnet restore` now launches but aborts with NETSDK1100 (EnableWindowsTargeting) and NETSDK1147 (missing maui-tizen workload) because Windows SDK/workloads are unavailable on this host.
  - 2026-04-08T00:00Z: `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln` retried for the authentication-gating batch; container still returns `bash: command not found: dotnet` so restore remains Windows-host only.
  - 2025-10-16T09:40Z: `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln` attempted for the Work Orders audit metadata batch; command exits immediately with `bash: command not found: dotnet` because the CLI is absent in this container.
  - 2026-04-12T09:05Z: `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln` retried alongside scheduling persistence regression coverage; container still reports `bash: command not found: dotnet`, leaving restore/build/test to run on Windows.
- [ ] MAUI builds *(blocked on Windows workloads; historical attempts failed before CLI install and the latest 2025-10-10 run surfaced NETSDK1147 requiring maui-tizen workload on Windows.)*
  - 2025-10-13T11:00Z: `dotnet build yasgmp.csproj -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0` retried after retarget; CLI still missing so the command exits with `bash: command not found: dotnet`.
  - 2026-04-04T09:12Z: `dotnet build yasgmp.csproj -c Release -p:EnableWindowsTargeting=true` retried; command still fails with `bash: command not found: dotnet` inside the container.
  - 2026-04-08T00:00Z: `dotnet build yasgmp.csproj -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0` retried while wiring the login dialog; command still exits with `bash: command not found: dotnet` because the CLI is absent on Linux.
  - 2025-10-16T09:41Z: `dotnet build yasgmp.csproj -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0` retried after updating Work Orders editor metadata; command still fails with `bash: command not found: dotnet`.
  - 2026-04-11T00:00Z: `dotnet build yasgmp.csproj -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0` rerun for asset QR parity validation; CLI remains unavailable so the command exits with `bash: command not found: dotnet`.
- [ ] WPF builds *(restore now runs but the 2025-10-10 Release builds failed on cross-targeted AppCore references — YasGMP.Helpers/Diagnostics namespaces and signature DTOs are unresolved until Windows desktop dependencies are available on a Windows host.)*
  - 2025-10-13T11:00Z: `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows` retried post-retarget; CLI still missing so the command exits with `bash: command not found: dotnet`.
  - 2025-10-10T11:25Z: `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -c Release -p:EnableWindowsTargeting=true` still fails — AppCore compilation reports missing YasGMP.Helpers/Diagnostics namespaces and SignatureMetadata DTOs during the Release build.
  - 2026-04-04T09:11Z: `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -c Release -p:EnableWindowsTargeting=true` retried; container still reports `bash: command not found: dotnet`.
  - 2025-10-10T10:11Z: `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -c Release -p:EnableWindowsTargeting=true` restores but fails with dozens of CS0234/CS0246/CS0535 errors because YasGMP.AppCore expects Helpers/Diagnostics projects and signature DTO types that are unavailable without the Windows solution build.
  - 2025-10-10T06:42Z: `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -c Release -p:EnableWindowsTargeting=true` restored packages but failed with unresolved YasGMP.Helpers/Diagnostics namespaces and missing SignatureMetadataDto/WorkOrderSignaturePersistRequest types — requires building on Windows with full solution references.
 - 2026-04-08T00:00Z: `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows` rerun after adding the login/reauth dialogs; CLI remains unavailable (`bash: command not found: dotnet`).
  - 2026-04-09T00:00Z: `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows` retried alongside MAUI code/QR parity changes; command still fails with `bash: command not found: dotnet` because the CLI is absent on Linux.

## Increment 2025-10-13 — Baseline Revalidation
- Confirmed the Linux container still lacks the `dotnet` CLI; documented env_guard for Increment 1 and kept execution static-analysis only.
- Prepared an end-to-end compliance backlog covering:
  - [ ] Repository-wide folder/module inventory aligned to SAP B1 form modes, CFL, golden arrows, RBAC, and audit overlays.
  - [ ] Database alignment plan (yasgmp.sql ↔ EF models ↔ DatabaseService extensions) with forthcoming `yasgmp.sql.delta.patch`.
  - [ ] Directory.Build.props review to centralise .NET 9 targeting, analyzer strictness, and documentation output enforcement.
  - [ ] EN↔HR localization sweep across Views/ViewModels/Resources ensuring runtime switch support and automation metadata.
  - [ ] Cross-cutting observability/security roadmap (structured logging, metrics, retention/legal hold, signature rotation).
- Next Increment Goals (Increment 2):
  1. **[x]** Draft per-folder inventory template and seed ModulesPane coverage notes.
  2. **[x]** Begin entity traceability mapping (Assets → Services → ViewModels → Views).
  3. **[x]** Outline audit/signature hash-chain upgrade specification for DatabaseService extensions.

### Increment 2 Artifact Drop — Documentation Deliverables

| Folder / Module | Primary Responsibility | SAP B1 Parity Hooks | Compliance / Notes | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AppShell.xaml` / `AppShell.xaml.cs` | WPF shell bootstrap, Ribbon + Dock host orchestration | FormMode toolbar wiring, ModulesPane registration | Localization + accessibility verified; smoke registration pending CLI | `In-Progress` |
| `ModulesPane` (Views/ViewModels) | Module navigation tree, localization metadata, automation ids | Golden Arrow launch points, CFL invocation shortcuts | Requires periodic update as modules go live; includes EN↔HR resources | `Tracked` |
| `Views/*` (per module) | Individual document hosts with inspector/editor panes | FormMode state machine binding, toolbar template reuse | Tooltips + AutomationProperties wired via resources | `Tracked` |
| `ViewModels/*` | B1FormDocumentViewModel derivatives orchestrating CRUD | Command gating, navigation payload reconciliation | Awaiting audit trail enrichment post hash-chain extensions | `Tracked` |
| `YasGMP.AppCore` | Shared models + adapters consumed by MAUI/WPF shells | Adapter/service parity, shared validation | XML docs enforced; audit hash linking queued | `Tracked` |
| `Services/DatabaseService` | Persistence gateway + layout/audit helpers | Choose-From-List lookups, attachments, signature capture | Hash-chain extension outlined below; implementation blocked on SDK validation | `Planned` |
| `docs/` | Planning, mapping, parity matrices | Acceptance checklist cross-reference | codex_plan / progress synchronized each batch | `Current` |

### Increment 2 Follow-up — Alerts & Notification Preferences (2026-04-10)

- Added cross-platform alert abstractions (`IAlertService` in AppCore and WPF `AlertService`) so shell status updates and toast overlays mirror MAUI alerts while respecting persisted operator preferences; the Admin module now exposes status bar/toast toggles with a save workflow wired to the new service.
- Introduced `NotificationPreferenceService` persistence, the shared `NotificationPreferences` model, and WPF unit tests covering alert propagation plus AdminModuleViewModel load/save/dirty states to guard the workflow.
- Refreshed `README_WPF_SHELL.md` and `docs/WPF_MAPPING.md` with alert parity details, toast overlay documentation, and notification preference UI notes.
- CLI status: `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build yasgmp.csproj -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0`, `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows`, and `dotnet test YasGMP.Wpf.Tests` still fail with `command not found` because the dotnet CLI is unavailable on this Linux host; rerun on a Windows machine with the Windows 10 SDK installed.
- Added a settings restore workflow: AdminModuleViewModel now consumes the electronic signature dialog, dialog service, and auth/session context so the new `RestoreSettingCommand` enforces confirmation prompts, signature capture/persistence, busy gating, audit logging, and triggers `RefreshCommand` after successful rollbacks while surfacing localized status/alert messages.
- Updated `AdminModuleView.xaml` with a localized restore button, automation metadata, and a QA-facing signature status indicator; ShellStrings (EN/HR) gained confirmation/status copy, and AdminModuleViewModel unit tests now cover confirmation decline, rollback failure, and success paths via stubbed dialog/auth services. Restore/build/test commands remain blocked with `command not found: dotnet` inside this container.
- Added regression coverage for stale selections: `RestoreSettingCommand_WhenRecordKeyMissing_UsesCodeLookup` verifies code-based fallback restores succeed after lookup mismatches.
- 2026-05-13: Authored RollbackPreviewDocumentViewModel unit tests that validate signature status, status-bar messaging, and rollback success/failure handling through the DatabaseService test hooks, and extended AdminModuleViewModel coverage to assert the electronic signature cancellation warning path; dotnet restore/build/test still fail with `command not found: dotnet` until Windows tooling is available.
- 2026-05-14: Introduced a WPF-facing `IDeviationCrudService` contract plus `DeviationCrudContext` helpers so deviation adapters can capture signature metadata and reuse MAUI localization/audit services; `dotnet restore`/`dotnet build`/`dotnet test` still fail with `bash: command not found: dotnet` in this container.
- 2026-05-15: Implemented `DeviationCrudServiceAdapter` to validate deviation payloads, normalize workflow status, apply signature/audit context (digital signature, last modified, source IP), call `DeviationService.CreateAsync/UpdateAsync`, and surface `CrudSaveResult` metadata for the shell; `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build yasgmp.csproj -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0`, and `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows` still fail with `bash: command not found: dotnet` until executed on a Windows host.

### Increment 2 Follow-up — Assets Smoke Automation (2026-04-22)

- Authored a FlaUI-driven Assets module smoke scenario that opens the module via the localized tree, exercises Find→Add→Update transitions, triggers the attachment guardrail, and verifies signature cancellation messaging to mirror SAP B1 form behaviour.
- CLI status: `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows`, `dotnet build yasgmp.csproj -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0`, and `dotnet test YasGMP.Wpf.Smoke/YasGMP.Wpf.Smoke.csproj -c Release` still fail with `command not found: dotnet`; Windows-host validation remains required.

### Increment 2 Follow-up — Code & QR Adapter Documentation (2026-04-20)

- Marked the code and QR helper parity rows in `docs/WPF_MAPPING.md` as complete now that WPF registers `CodeGeneratorServiceAdapter`/`QRCodeServiceAdapter` and exposes toolbar commands mirroring MAUI automation.
- Added operator guidance noting the Generate Code and Preview QR buttons in the Assets/Components toolbars so shell users know where to trigger auto-identifiers and label previews.
- Re-ran restore/build commands listed above; each continues to exit with `bash: command not found: dotnet` pending a Windows host.
- 2026-04-11: Assets module view-model now auto-generates machine codes and QR PNGs via new toolbar commands, persists previews into the platform app data directory, and extends localization/unit tests for the workflow; `dotnet restore`/`dotnet build` remain blocked with `bash: command not found: dotnet` in this container.

### Increment 2 Follow-up — Assets module service parity (2026-04-10)

- Injected `ICodeGeneratorService`, `IQRCodeService`, and `IPlatformService` into `AssetsModuleViewModel` so code/QR generation and platform metadata mirror the MAUI shell without resorting to service locator fallbacks.
- Added dedicated WPF test doubles for the new services and refreshed `AssetsModuleViewModelTests`/`ModuleCflTests` to wire the dependencies explicitly, keeping regression coverage intact.
- `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln` was rerun to validate the batch but continues to exit with `bash: command not found: dotnet`; Windows-host verification remains required.
- 2026-04-11: Asset editor now surfaces `QrCode`/`QrPayload` observable properties, copies them across create/clone/save flows, and updates machine cloning so WPF persistence mirrors the MAUI shell; dotnet restore/build still fail with `bash: command not found: dotnet` until run on Windows.
- 2026-04-12: Added localized toolbar actions for QR generation/preview in `AssetsModuleView`, routed preview execution through `IShellInteractionService.PreviewDocument`, refreshed EN/HR shell resources, and extended Assets module tests to assert shell preview invocation; dotnet restore/build remain blocked with `bash: command not found: dotnet` in this container.
- 2026-04-13: Expanded Assets module regression coverage to validate code/QR generation in add/update modes, preview enablement/dirty tracking, and PNG persistence under the platform app-data root; `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj`, and `dotnet test YasGMP.Wpf.Tests` continue to fail with `bash: command not found: dotnet` on this Linux container.
- 2026-04-14: Components module now wires Generate/Preview QR and attachment commands via the injected code generator/QR/platform services, mirrors Assets command gating, and extends unit coverage; `dotnet restore`, `dotnet build`, and `dotnet test` still exit with `bash: command not found: dotnet` until run on a Windows host.
- 2026-04-18: Components module view now surfaces the attachment, code generation, and QR preview toolbar actions with localized content/tooltips/automation metadata matching the new commands; `dotnet restore`, `dotnet build`, and `dotnet test` continue to exit with `bash: command not found: dotnet` inside this container.
- 2026-04-19: Preventive maintenance workspace added to the WPF shell; `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build yasgmp.csproj -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0`, `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows`, and `dotnet test YasGMP.Wpf.Smoke/YasGMP.Wpf.Smoke.csproj -c Release` still return `bash: command not found: dotnet` because the CLI is unavailable in the container.

### Increment 2 Follow-up — Parts inventory transaction coverage (2026-04-24)

- Extended the test-only `YasGMP.Services.DatabaseService` stub with configurable warehouse listings, per-part zone metrics, and inventory history hooks so Parts module refresh logic can run in isolation.
- Introduced a `RecordingInventoryTransactionService` fake that captures each request/context and can toggle simulated failures for command coverage.
- Rewrote `PartsModuleViewModelTests` to drive receive/issue/adjust flows via reflection, assert shell status messaging, verify zone filter projections, and exercise the failure path that clears alerts/history.
- CLI status: `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build yasgmp.csproj -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0`, and `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows` still exit with `bash: command not found: dotnet`; smoke harness remains blocked pending a Windows host.

### Increment 2 Follow-up — Asset editor view-model consolidation (2026-04-11)

- Registered the reusable `AssetViewModel` with the WPF container so module view-models consume the shared asset state instead of private payloads.
- Replaced the nested `AssetEditor` class in `AssetsModuleViewModel`, rewired property-changed dirty tracking, and funneled toolbar commands/QR helpers through the injected singleton.
- Updated `AssetsModuleView` bindings plus `AssetsModuleViewModelTests` to target `AssetViewModel`, keeping code/QR generation and signature coverage intact.
- 2026-04-21: Synced `AssetsModuleViewModel` dock records with `AssetViewModel.FilteredAssets`, exposed pass-through search/filter properties, and re-bound the Assets grid to the shared collection so shell search inputs update both the dock list and inspector.
- 2026-04-22: Navigation + CFL flows now resolve selections through `AssetViewModel.FilteredAssets`, synchronize `_assetViewModel.SelectedAsset`/`_loadedMachine`, and rebuild inspector payloads from the shared asset snapshot instead of re-querying `IMachineCrudService`.
- 2026-04-23: AssetsModuleViewModel now listens for `FilteredAssets.CollectionChanged`, reprojects records/selection/status when the shared list mutates, propagates `AssetViewModel.StatusMessage`/search text to the shell, and reuses the dirty-tracking suppression around collection subscriptions; `dotnet restore/build/test` remain blocked with `bash: command not found: dotnet` in this container.
- 2026-04-24: Asset view-model now fronts CRUD via `IMachineCrudService`, OnRecordSelected/OnSave flow through shared add/update routines, and post-save refreshes repopulate `_assetViewModel.FilteredAssets`/status so both shell panes stay synchronized; `dotnet restore/build/test` still fail with `bash: command not found: dotnet` inside this Linux container.
- 2026-04-24: AssetsModuleView.xaml now binds the grid to `Asset.FilteredAssets`, scopes inspector controls to the shared editor payload, and reaffirms signature metadata bindings; `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln` remains blocked with `bash: command not found: dotnet` until run on Windows.
- 2026-04-26: Registered the shared AssetViewModel singleton in the WPF host, synchronized the shell adapter with the MAUI payload, and initially rebound the Assets grid to `SharedAsset.FilteredAssets` (superseded on 2026-05-10 by the module-scoped `Asset.FilteredAssets` binding); `dotnet restore/build/test` still exit with `bash: command not found: dotnet` pending Windows validation.
- 2026-05-10: Assets document view now surfaces shared + module status banners, the grid consumes `Asset.FilteredAssets`, and new unit coverage exercises add/update CRUD paths with signature persistence spies; `dotnet restore`, `dotnet build`, and `dotnet test` continue to fail with `bash: command not found: dotnet` in this container.
- CLI status: `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln` remains blocked with `bash: command not found: dotnet`; Windows-host validation is still required.

### Increment 2 Follow-up — External Servicers oversight workspace (2026-05-05)

- Added a third column to `ExternalServicersModuleView` for a contractor oversight workspace with KPI tiles, intervention timeline, and analytics table surfaces bound to upcoming view-model collections.
- Wired localized headers, tooltips, and automation metadata (EN/HR) for the oversight pane, including refresh/drill-in buttons targeting new `RefreshOversightCommand` and `DrillIntoOversightCommand` handlers on the module view-model.
- Injected `DatabaseService` into `ExternalServicersModuleViewModel` to hydrate contractor interventions, compute KPI/timeline/analytics aggregates on the UI dispatcher, and expose new observable collections/commands consumed by the oversight pane with EN/HR localization and unit coverage for the dispatcher/DatabaseService override path.
- 2026-05-06: Recalibrated the oversight refresh pipeline so `LoadAsync`, selection changes, and the explicit refresh command all call `DatabaseService.GetAllContractorInterventionsAsync`, rebuild KPI/timeline/analytics projections, marshal updates onto the dispatcher, and surface failures through `StatusMessage`.
- CLI status: `dotnet restore`, `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows`, and `dotnet build yasgmp.csproj -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0` were retried; each still exits with `bash: command not found: dotnet` because the .NET SDK is unavailable in this Linux container. WPF smoke automation remains TODO pending Windows tooling.
- 2026-05-07: Documented the delivered oversight pane and contractor dashboards in `docs/WPF_MAPPING.md`, replacing the external servicer TODO callouts with the live data sources.
- 2026-05-08: Added regression tests for Suppliers audit timeline loading and contract preview flows using configurable audit/attachment stubs; `dotnet restore/build/test` still return `bash: command not found: dotnet` in this container.
- 2026-05-08: Extended External Servicers oversight tests to assert KPI/timeline/analytics projections and drill-in navigation targets via recording module navigation fakes; CLI remains unavailable so Windows-host validation is still required.
- 2026-05-09: Audit module now launches a rollback preview document that renders old/new JSON, signature verification, and rollback commands through the WPF shell; localization resources and toolbar automation ids were added while CLI validation remains blocked in the container.

#### Audit / Signature Hash-Chain Extension (Draft Outline)

1. **Hash Model Extension:** Introduce `AuditEnvelopeHash` (GUID, PreviousHash, CurrentHash, Timestamp, ActorMetadata) persisted via `DatabaseService` to maintain an append-only chain keyed per entity instance.
2. **Signature Capture Integration:** Update `IElectronicSignatureDialogService` consumers to include the computed `CurrentHash` and previous envelope reference in the signature manifest before persisting.
3. **DatabaseService Extensions:** Add `AppendAuditHashAsync(entityKey, auditPayload, signatureMetadata)` which calculates SHA-256 of serialized audit payload + previous hash, stores both the audit row and hash envelope transactionally, and returns the persisted hash token to the caller for UI confirmation.
4. **ViewModel Surfacing:** Extend module view-models to surface the latest hash token, enabling the inspector/status bar to display verification cues and emit correlation identifiers for smoke automation.
5. **Verification Workflow:** Outline periodic verification routines (scheduled job + manual command) that recompute hash chains per entity, flag tampering anomalies, and surface the status through the dashboard/reporting modules.

### Increment 2 Update — 2026-04-07 Localization Sweep
- Localized Assets module status messages through ShellStrings (neutral/en/hr) and routed AssetsModuleViewModel status surfaces through `ILocalizationService` so runtime language switches stay in sync.
- Expanded Assets module unit coverage to assert localized status messaging via `LocalizationService`, noting that build/test execution still awaits dotnet CLI availability (env_guard=static-analysis).

## Decisions & Pins
- Preferred WPF target: **net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0** (retain once .NET 9 SDK is installed).
- MAUI shell retargeted to **net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0** with MAUI Controls 9.0.110 and EF Core 9.0.x stack pinned for .NET 9 compatibility (Windows validation pending).
- Repo-level SDK pin: `global.json` set to **9.0.100** *(reinforced via bootstrap script).* 
- AvalonDock: **4.72.1** *(pinned in `YasGMP.Wpf.csproj`).*
- Other NuGets: **Fluent.Ribbon 11.0.1**, **CommunityToolkit.Mvvm 8.4.0**, **Microsoft.Extensions.* 9.0.3**, **MySqlConnector 2.4.0** *(pinned in csproj).*
- AppCore now multi-targets **net8.0;net9.0** via `Directory.Build.props` so WPF/Maui hosts can migrate without breaking net8 consumers.
- Environment gap: Windows desktop prerequisites (Windows 10 SDK 19041+, MAUI workloads) must still be installed on a Windows host. The linux container now carries .NET SDK 9.0.305 via dotnet-install, but cross-targeted builds/tests must run on Windows.

## Batches
- **B0 — Environment stabilization** (SDKs, NuGets, XAML namespaces) — **blocked** *(Windows 10 SDK/workloads absent; dotnet 9 CLI now present)*
  - 2025-10-10: dotnet-install.sh reran with `--channel 9.0` to upgrade the local SDK to 9.0.305; Windows 10 SDK provisioning must occur on Windows because the Linux container cannot host the installer.
  - 2025-10-10: Installed dotnet SDK 9.0.100 via dotnet-install.sh and verified `dotnet --info`; Windows-targeted restore/build/test still require Windows 10 SDK 19041+ and MAUI workloads on a Windows host.
  - 2025-10-07: Reconfirmed CLI absence this run; planning next increment around static analysis, documentation refresh, and schema review until installation is possible.
  - 2025-10-08: Authored `WPF Smoke Tests` GitHub Actions workflow to run restore/build/FlaUI smoke automation on `windows-latest` using .NET 9 when available (falls back to .NET 8). Local validation remains blocked because `dotnet --info` still reports `command not found`.
- **B1 — Shell foundation** (Ribbon, Docking, StatusBar, FormMode state machine) — [ ] todo
  - **Remaining scope:**
    - Validate the Fluent.Ribbon tabs, status bar telemetry, and ModulesPane localization on a Windows host once the .NET CLI and Windows 10 SDK are available.
    - Exercise DockLayoutPersistenceService reset/save flows against the production database snapshot to confirm AvalonDock layout round-tripping.
    - Run the YasGMP.Wpf.Smoke harness to verify form mode transitions, localization refresh, and automation identifiers once builds succeed.
  - 2025-10-10: `B1FormDocumentViewModel.CanEnterMode` now blocks transitions when validation errors exist (except returning to Find), prevents Add re-entry while dirty, and requires a selected record for View/Update so toolbar enablement mirrors SAP B1 semantics; `dotnet restore` now runs but Windows-targeted build/test attempts fail with NETSDK1100/NU1201 until the Windows 10 SDK and workloads are available.
  - 2025-10-10: DockLayoutPersistenceService test focus run attempted via `dotnet test YasGMP.Wpf.Tests --filter FullyQualifiedName~DockLayoutPersistenceServiceTests -c Release -p:EnableWindowsTargeting=true`; restore surfaced NU1605 downgrade + NU1201 compatibility errors because YasGMP.Wpf targets net9.0-windows10.0.19041 and Windows-only SDKs are unavailable.
  - 2025-10-10T11:25Z: Retried `dotnet test YasGMP.Wpf.Tests -c Release -p:EnableWindowsTargeting=true --filter FullyQualifiedName~DockLayoutPersistenceServiceTests`; restore still fails (NU1605 downgrade to Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Abstractions 9.0.0 and NU1201 because YasGMP.Wpf targets net9.0-windows10.0.19041).
  - 2025-10-10: FlaUI smoke harness `dotnet test YasGMP.Wpf.Smoke/YasGMP.Wpf.Smoke.csproj -c Release -p:EnableWindowsTargeting=true` fails restore with NU1605 downgrades and NU1201 because YasGMP.Wpf only targets net9.0-windows10.0.19041; requires Windows 10 SDK + workloads.
  - 2026-01-25: Documented B1FormDocumentViewModel command/state surface so derived modules inherit SAP B1 toolbar, audit, and busy-state guidance.
  - 2026-02-10: Modules pane groups/links now source localized headers, tooltips, automation names/ids through ILocalizationService subscriptions so culture switches update without rebuilding the tree; awaiting SDK install to validate via build/smoke.
  - 2026-02-11: ModulesPane XAML now binds group expanders and module buttons to the localized headers/tooltips/automation metadata exposed by their view-models so accessibility/name/id updates propagate directly through the UI tree.
  - 2026-02-12: Strings.xaml now carries automation id tokens for every ModuleRegistry category/module (Cockpit, SupplyChain, QualityCompliance, etc.) so ModuleTreeViewModel resolves sanitized identifiers for UIA and smoke harnesses even when localization falls back.
  - 2026-02-13: Inspector pane view-model now publishes localized module header automation name/id/tooltip metadata and refreshes them on language switches while dotnet restore/build/smoke remain blocked by the missing CLI.
  - 2026-02-14: Inspector pane titles and automation metadata now pull formatting templates from ShellStrings so module/record captions plus UIA names/ids/tooltips reformat with active context whenever localization changes while dotnet restore/build/smoke remain blocked by the missing CLI.
  - 2026-02-15: Inspector pane update now recomputes module automation name/id/tooltip using localized templates with fallback defaults for empty context and refreshes cached metadata on language changes; dotnet restore/build/smoke still blocked by the missing CLI.
  - 2026-03-25: B1FormDocumentViewModel now refreshes toolbar command states when records change, cancel resets run, and dirty flags flip so SAP B1 toggles stay in sync even when mode remains unchanged; dotnet restore/build/smoke still blocked pending CLI availability.
- 2026-03-26: Added regression tests that assert B1FormDocumentViewModel keeps View/Update disabled without a selection, blocks Add while dirty, and rejects mode transitions when validation errors are present; `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln` retried and the container still reports `bash: command not found: dotnet`, so build/test/smoke remain pending SDK install.
- 2026-03-27: Centralized the module toolbar toggle template in `ModuleToolbarResources.xaml`, merged it into each module view, and added WPF coverage that instantiates the template to assert tooltips and automation metadata refresh after localization changes; `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build yasgmp.csproj -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0`, and `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows` each still return `bash: command not found: dotnet` in this container.
- 2026-04-12: Scheduling module regression tests now assert update-mode saves forward signature metadata to the preventive maintenance adapters and that disabling a job updates the adapter snapshot; `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln` still exits with `bash: command not found: dotnet`, so Windows-host validation remains pending.
- 2026-03-31: ModuleToolbarCommand template test now also asserts `ToolTipService.ShowOnDisabled` remains true alongside the localized tooltip and automation metadata so the shared toggle keeps accessibility hints when disabled; `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build yasgmp.csproj -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0`, and `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows` still fail with `bash: command not found: dotnet` pending CLI availability.
- 2026-04-03: Refined `B1FormDocumentViewModel.CanEnterMode` so View/Update stay disabled without a selection, Add refuses to run while the editor is dirty or carrying validation errors, and Find remains re-entrant. Selection, validation, save, and cancel paths now call `RefreshCommandStates()` so toolbar enablement updates immediately. Added WPF unit tests covering null-selection, dirty-editor, validation-error, and find re-entry scenarios. `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -c Release -p:EnableWindowsTargeting=true`, and `dotnet test YasGMP.Wpf.Tests/YasGMP.Wpf.Tests.csproj -c Release -p:EnableWindowsTargeting=true` still fail with `bash: command not found: dotnet` because the CLI is unavailable in this container.
- 2026-04-06: Assets module grid cell automation names now bind to the underlying row values (Code, Title, Status, Location) instead of repeating header resources, restoring screen-reader announcements while preserving localized tooltips and automation identifiers; dotnet restore/build/test remain blocked with `bash: command not found: dotnet` until the CLI is provisioned on a Windows host.
- 2026-04-09: Registered CodeGeneratorService/QRCodeService adapters in the WPF host so modules can request shared code and QR helpers via DI while maintaining MAUI parity; `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows`, and MAUI Windows builds still fail with `bash: command not found: dotnet` in this container.
- 2026-04-16: Components module editor now mirrors the asset workflow with code override toggles, QR payload/path bindings, and linked-document collections; AppCore Component/MachineComponent models plus DatabaseService mappers persist QR metadata and attachment references. `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows`, and `dotnet build yasgmp.csproj -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0` still return `bash: command not found: dotnet` in this Linux container.
- 2026-04-17: ComponentsModuleViewModel now normalizes status/code/QR artifacts through shared helpers during mode changes, validation, and saves, persists regenerated PNGs before calling CreateAsync/UpdateAsync, and surfaces localized status messages aligned with the MAUI client. `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build yasgmp.csproj -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0`, and `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows` still fail with `command not found` because the CLI remains absent on this Linux host.
- 2026-04-18: Added WPF unit coverage that exercises Components module code/QR generation commands, toolbar gating across form modes/busy states, and CRUD persistence parity with the MAUI client. `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build yasgmp.csproj -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0`, `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows`, and `dotnet test YasGMP.Wpf.Tests` still return `bash: command not found: dotnet` inside this container; Windows host validation required.
- 2026-04-19: Extended Assets/Components module regression suites to assert the new code/QR generation commands persist identifiers through their adapters and surface localized status messaging. Added MAUI dialog/unit coverage that verifies the Machine editor exposes auto-code/QR actions and that the view-model writes QR images using the same `{code}.png` convention consumed by WPF. `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build yasgmp.csproj -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0`, `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows`, and associated `dotnet test` commands remain blocked with `bash: command not found: dotnet` on this Linux host.
- 2026-04-22: Calibration module now surfaces a certificate metadata dialog that stages upload/removal alongside editor bindings; expanded metadata persistence is pending schema updates. `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build yasgmp.csproj -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0`, and `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows` remain blocked (`command not found`).
- 2026-04-23: Suppliers module tests now assert CrudSaveResult metadata rehydrates the editor (digital signature id/hash/reason/note/device/session/ip) without dirtying the form after saves; restore/build remain blocked pending dotnet CLI access on Windows.
- 2026-04-23: Parts module now exposes stock receive/issue/adjust toolbar commands wired to a WPF StockTransactionDialog that captures document/note/signature metadata, routes through a new InventoryTransactionServiceAdapter wrapping DatabaseService inventory helpers, and surfaces zone-filterable warehouse summaries, transaction alerts, and recent inventory grids in the editor. `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build yasgmp.csproj -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0`, and `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows` remain blocked with `command not found` until a Windows host is available.
- 2026-04-30: Updated docs/WPF_MAPPING.md to reflect the new stock dialogs, alert banners, and zone filters now live in the WPF Parts and Warehouse documents; parity now references the shared inventory helpers consumed by InventoryTransactionServiceAdapter and WarehouseCrudServiceAdapter.
- 2026-04-01: Promoted the module toolbar template coverage into `ModuleToolbarTests` and moved `FakeLocalizationService` into the shared WPF test doubles so toolbar command and template fixtures reuse the localization stub; `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build yasgmp.csproj -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0`, and `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows` still fail with `bash: command not found: dotnet` in this container.
- 2026-02-16: Inspector header strings now rebuild from the latest localization templates before applying property updates, and inspector field payloads feed through a helper that regenerates automation name/id/tooltip metadata from the active module/record text (with fallback normalization for legacy field lists) so accessibility tooling receives stable identifiers even before the CLI is restored; `dotnet restore` retried this batch and still reports **command not found**.
- 2026-02-17: Inspector pane language-change handler now replays the field automation helper against existing rows using localized placeholders when context is empty, and raises property change notifications so accessibility consumers pick up the refreshed metadata; `dotnet restore`/`dotnet build` retried this batch and still fail with **command not found** while the CLI is missing.
- 2026-02-18: Inspector field view-model now accepts a recomputation delegate from the pane so automation name/id/tooltip metadata refresh automatically whenever field values mutate, keeping accessibility strings aligned with the current module/record context; `dotnet restore` retried for this batch continues to return **command not found** because the CLI is still unavailable.
- 2026-02-19: Centralized automation token normalization via AutomationIdSanitizer so module, record, and field identifiers reuse the same lowercase/trimmed/separator-stable helper with predictable defaults; `dotnet restore` retried this batch still exits with **command not found** because the CLI remains absent.
- 2026-02-20: Inspector test doubles now call AutomationIdSanitizer for module/record/field tokens so WPF tests align with production automation identifiers while `dotnet restore` continues to fail with **command not found** due to the missing CLI.
- 2026-02-21: Added AutomationIdSanitizer and InspectorField regression tests that assert sanitized automation ids across null/empty, locale-specific, and punctuation-heavy inputs; `dotnet restore`, `dotnet build` (MAUI + WPF), and smoke/test attempts still return **command not found** because the CLI remains unavailable.
- 2026-02-22: Inspector pane XAML now binds module/record headers to the localized automation name/id/tooltip properties exposed by the view-model so UIA metadata flows to screen readers; `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf.csproj` retried this batch and still fails with **command not found** because the CLI remains unavailable in the container. Inspect/FlaUI validation remains pending until a Windows host with the WPF shell is available.
- 2026-02-23: Inspector field item template now binds each row container to the localized automation name/id/tooltip so UIA tools can announce field metadata correctly; `dotnet restore` and `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj` retried this batch and still exit with **command not found** because the CLI remains unavailable. FlaUI verification remains pending until a Windows host with the WPF shell is available.
- 2026-02-24: Module tree localization resources now mirror every ModuleRegistry category/module across neutral, en, and hr resx files; `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln` and `dotnet build yasgmp.sln` retried for this batch still fail with **command not found** because the .NET CLI is absent in the container.
- 2026-02-25: Inspector field automation metadata now reads neutral/en/hr templates from ShellStrings with localized record fallbacks so the pane composes UIA names/tooltips in both languages; `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build yasgmp.sln`, and `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows` each still return **command not found** because the .NET SDK is missing.
- 2026-03-01: Added YasGMP.Wpf.Smoke FlaUI harness that builds/launches the WPF shell, drives module navigation, and asserts Modules pane + inspector automation ids/names/tooltips update when switching between English/Croatian; `dotnet restore/build` retried this batch still fail with **command not found** because the CLI is absent.
- 2026-03-02: Added XML documentation to ShellStatusBarViewModel status text and active module properties to satisfy CS1591 while `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln` and `dotnet build yasgmp.sln -c Release` continue to fail with **command not found** because the CLI is unavailable in the container.
- 2026-03-03: Modules pane root now binds Dock.Modules automation name/help text alongside expander/button HelpText bindings and the FlaUI smoke test expects the new resources; `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows`, and MAUI Windows builds still fail with **command not found** while the CLI is absent.
- 2026-03-05: ShellStatusBarViewModel now refreshes company/environment/server/database/user metadata from IConfiguration, DatabaseOptions, IHostEnvironment, and IUserSession, ShellStatusBar.xaml binds tooltips/automation ids for every field, and WPF tests assert EN↔HR localization plus automation metadata; `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build yasgmp.sln`, and `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows` retried for this batch and continue to fail with **command not found** because the CLI is unavailable.

- 2026-03-10: Shell status messages, layout reset prompts, and smoke-test notifications now resolve through ShellStrings resx keys with MainWindowViewModel, ShellLayoutController, and ShellStatusBarViewModel consuming ILocalizationService; status bar fallback values re-localize on language switches and new WPF unit tests assert EN↔HR toggles for the Active label and metadata. `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows`, and `dotnet build yasgmp.csproj -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0` were retried this batch and all still return **command not found** because the .NET CLI is missing. WPF smoke automation remains blocked by the same CLI gap.
- 2026-03-11: ModulesPane.xaml now applies scoped styles that bind each expander/button to the localized tooltip/help text and automation name/id exposed by module metadata, InspectorPaneViewModel consumes localized field automation templates (including a new automation-id resource) so plain InspectorField rows recompute culture-aware names/tooltips/ids, and WPF unit tests assert the localized fallbacks; `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows`, and `dotnet build yasgmp.csproj -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0` were each retried this batch and continue to fail with **command not found** because the CLI is still missing in the container.
- 2026-03-12: Shell status bar view-model documentation now calls out the configuration/session services backing each property, status bar control tests assert every label/value uses the localized tooltip/help text plus automation name/id from ShellStrings/Strings, and `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows`, and `dotnet build yasgmp.csproj -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0` were retried; all commands still return **command not found** because the .NET CLI is unavailable in the container.
- 2026-03-12: Layout persistence helpers now force the `@layout` parameter to `LongText` so longer AvalonDock XML snapshots round-trip without truncation, and regression tests assert the parameter typing across DatabaseService + WPF persistence paths; `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows`, and MAUI/WPF builds remain blocked by **command not found** until the .NET CLI is installed.
- 2026-03-12: Added a ModuleToolbarCommand regression test that stubs ILocalizationService, flips EN↔HR, and asserts caption/tooltip/automation metadata refresh on LanguageChanged; `dotnet test YasGMP.Wpf.Tests` retried this batch and still fails with **command not found** because the CLI is unavailable in the container.

- 2026-03-15: Centralized the module toolbar ToggleButton template into `Resources/ModuleToolbarResources.xaml` and merged it via `App.xaml` so every module/document toolbar pulls caption/command/check/enabled/tooltip/automation bindings from view-models; `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln` retried for this batch still returns **command not found** because the CLI is unavailable, preventing runtime verification of tooltip/automation updates.
- 2026-03-16: Added `ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries` imports for `ModuleToolbarResources.xaml` to every module/document view so toolbar ItemsControls bind the shared ToggleButton template without local definitions; spot-checked Assets, Dashboard, and Audit module views to confirm the centralized template loads while `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build yasgmp.sln`, and `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows` each still report **command not found** because the CLI remains unavailable.
- 2026-03-17: Assets module activation now routes navigation payloads through the helper to focus existing records and only triggers `RefreshAsync` when the target is missing; `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build yasgmp.sln`, and `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows` remain blocked with **command not found** until the CLI is installed.
- 2026-03-10: Shell status bar value fields now expose AutomationProperties.LabeledBy links to their localized label blocks, XML docs call out configuration/session sources for metadata, and WPF tests assert the new associations while `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build yasgmp.sln`, and `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows` continue to fail with **command not found** due to the missing CLI.
- 2026-03-10: Layout persistence helpers now include null-row regression coverage so DatabaseService + DockLayoutPersistenceService return null snapshots without raising, and `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows`, plus `dotnet build yasgmp.csproj -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0` continue to fail with **command not found** while the CLI is missing.
- **B2 — Cross-cutting** (Attachments DB, E-Signature, Audit) — [~] in-progress *(e-sign capture now spans Assets, Components, Warehouses, Incidents, CAPA, Change Control, Validations, Scheduled Jobs, Suppliers, External Servicers, Users, and Work Orders; WPF adapters and AppCore services propagate optional signature metadata through to the database, falling back to the legacy hash generator only when metadata is missing; the WPF dialog service now emits audit events on capture/persist and Work Orders already surfaces the inspector timeline/signature manifest while broader audit surfacing in other modules remains gated on SDK access)*
  - **Remaining scope:**
    - Surface audit timelines and signature manifests inside each WPF module inspector/pane once Windows builds unblock UI verification.
    - Finish attachment preview/download parity for modules still using placeholder dialogs and confirm retention policies under WPF adapters.
    - Enable automatic electronic signature prompts for legacy modules (Diagnostics, Admin) and validate hybrid host adapter detection once WpfPlatformService can run under smoke automation.
- 2026-03-04: DatabaseService now exposes layout-specific helpers that upsert/delete `user_window_layouts` entries and emit `LAYOUT_SAVE`/`LAYOUT_RESET` audit events (including session/device/signature context) so WPF + MAUI shells share immutable traces; DockLayoutPersistenceService consumes the extensions via DI (DatabaseService + IAuthContext) and unit coverage asserts SQL parameters plus audit forwarding.
- 2026-03-07: DockLayoutPersistenceService failure propagation test now passes a default `WindowGeometry` instance to avoid nullable struct compilation errors while `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf.Tests` continues to fail with **command not found** because the CLI is unavailable.
- **B3 — Editor framework** (templates, host, unsaved-guard) — [ ] todo
- **B4+ — Module rollout:**
  - Assets/Machines — [x] done *(mode-aware CRUD with attachment uploads and e-signature capture via IElectronicSignatureDialogService; audit surfacing still pending)*
    - 2026-03-24: Updated Assets module regression coverage to assert navigation parameter filters use machine code/id in search text and status messaging while dotnet restore/build remain blocked by the missing CLI.
  - 2026-03-28: Assets navigation now normalizes id/code payloads (ints, strings, dictionaries, ModuleRecord) so Golden Arrow drill-down filters reapply SelectedRecord/SearchText/Status after refresh; `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows`, and `dotnet test YasGMP.Wpf.Tests` still fail with **command not found** until the CLI is installed.
  - 2026-03-30: Reworked B1FormDocumentViewModel.CanEnterMode to require a selected record for View/Update, keep Find re-entrant, and block Add while dirty or showing validation errors; RefreshCommandStates now runs after validation/save/cancel flows and new unit tests cover null selection, dirty editor, and validation error scenarios. `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -c Debug`, `dotnet build yasgmp.csproj -c Debug`, and `dotnet test YasGMP.Wpf.Tests/YasGMP.Wpf.Tests.csproj` still return **command not found** because the dotnet CLI is unavailable in this container.
  - 2026-04-02: Tightened B1FormDocumentViewModel command gating again so View/Update stay disabled without a selection, Add refuses to activate while the editor is dirty or carrying validation errors, and Find can be re-entered even when already active; selection, validation, save, and cancel paths all call RefreshCommandStates so toolbar toggles update immediately. Regression tests now assert the null-selection, dirty-editor, validation-error, and find re-entry cases. `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -c Release -p:EnableWindowsTargeting=true`, `dotnet build yasgmp.csproj -c Release -p:EnableWindowsTargeting=true`, and `dotnet test YasGMP.Wpf.Smoke/YasGMP.Wpf.Smoke.csproj -c Release -p:EnableWindowsTargeting=true` were retried this batch and each still fail with **command not found** because the dotnet CLI remains unavailable in the container.
  - 2026-04-01: Assets module now queues navigation highlight state so LoadAsync/OnActivatedAsync filter by id/code payloads after refresh, reselect the target row, and preserve the filtered status message; new unit coverage asserts machine-id drill-down rehydrates SelectedRecord/SearchText while `dotnet restore yasgmp.sln`, WPF/MAUI builds, and smoke automation remain blocked by the missing CLI.
  - 2026-04-04: Assets LoadAsync/OnActivatedAsync now derive a navigation context for machine id/code payloads (including dictionaries), trim record lists to matches when possible, and queue a SelectedRecord reselect so inspector/toolbar state syncs after drill-down; regression coverage opens the module with an `assetId` navigation parameter to assert SelectedRecord, SearchText, filtered status messaging, and toolbar enablement while restore/build/smoke remain blocked without the CLI.
  - Assets — [x] done *(AssetsModuleView now fronts shared AssetViewModel/IMachineCrudService flows with attachment staging, signature-gated saves, QR/code commands, and inspector synchronization matching MAUI.)*

  - Suppliers/External Servicers — [x] done *(Suppliers module enforces electronic signatures on save alongside attachments + CFL; External Servicers cockpit now also blocks persistence on signature capture)*
  - Audit/API Audit — [~] in-progress *(WPF audit trail retains export filters and status guards; MAUI AuditLogViewModel now drives the shell document with synchronized inspector/search/export parity and resolves through DI with the shared DatabaseService; WPF Audit Log document view mirrors the dashboard patterns with toolbar buttons, filters, busy overlay, and status styling; new API audit module surfaces masked API key activity with inspector payloads, dynamic action filters, and smoke registration. These audit-focused modules are now grouped under the "Quality & Compliance" category in the ModuleRegistry.)*
    - 2026-01-12: Date range normalization now promotes the earliest selected day to FilterFrom and the latest to FilterTo so the formatted descriptions and export payloads reflect the true chronological span while CLI validation remains blocked by the missing dotnet toolchain.
    - 2026-01-14: API audit view-model tests now expose refresh invocation tracking with awaitable signals, covering each filter setter's auto-refresh behavior and verifying state resets while dotnet restore/build remain blocked by the missing CLI.

    - 2026-01-21: Centralized B1 status phrases and module titles in ShellStrings with localization-backed formatting helpers, updated module option lists to pull translated labels, and refreshed unit tests with a deterministic localization stub while the dotnet CLI gap persists.
  - 2025-10-06: Container check reconfirmed the absence of the `dotnet` CLI; planning scope remains constrained to static analysis and documentation updates until the SDK is provisioned.
  - 2026-01-15: Updated `docs/WPF_MAPPING.md` Quality & Compliance parity map with an API Audit Trail row noting masked API key metadata, dynamic action filters, and busy/error guards so documentation matches the current WPF implementation while dotnet restore/build remain blocked by the missing CLI.
  - Documents/Attachments — [x] done *(Attachments module now ships a finalized split inspector/editor workspace with staged upload queueing, signature-gated CRUD flow, and retention policy handling.)*
    - 2026-01-05: Attachments view now splits the layout into a records grid and inspector/editor pane that surfaces SelectedAttachment metadata alongside staged upload previews and retention flags.
    - 2026-01-06: Editor pane now drives staged uploads through the AttachmentService, requiring an electronic signature before committing changes and hiding commands when the workflow is unavailable.
    - 2026-01-07: Attachments editor now enforces retention rules during save/delete, shows busy overlays tied to IsBusy, and surfaces validation/status messaging while dotnet restore/build remain blocked by the missing CLI.
  - Dashboard/Reports — [~] in-progress *(dashboard cockpit now binds toolbar toggles, CFL/Golden Arrow commands, search label, and grid columns through the localization service with automation metadata for Accessibility Insights/FlaUI validation; module tree categories/nodes now surface localized captions/tooltips across EN↔HR switches.)*
    - 2026-04-08: Documented DashboardModuleView + ModulesPane coverage in `docs/WPF_MAPPING.md` so parity matrix reflects localized KPIs and navigation metadata; `dotnet restore`, `dotnet build YasGMP.Wpf/YasGMP.Wpf.csproj -f net9.0-windows`, and `dotnet build yasgmp.csproj -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0` were retried and each still fail immediately with `bash: command not found: dotnet` while the CLI remains unavailable in this container.
    - 2026-04-09: Introduced a WPF SignalRClientService that wraps AppCore SignalRService + BackgroundScheduler via the dispatcher, wired DashboardModuleViewModel to refresh on audit pushes, localized status bar connection states, and added backoff/reconnect unit coverage; dotnet CLI remains unavailable so execution stays static-analysis only.
  - Settings/Admin — [ ] todo

- **Open Issues / Blockers**
- Windows desktop prerequisites missing. .NET 9 SDK 9.0.305 is now installed via dotnet-install, but Windows 10 SDK 19041+ and MAUI workloads remain absent so cross-targeted restore/build/test fail with NETSDK1100/NETSDK1147/NU1201/NU1605. Run `scripts/bootstrap-dotnet9.ps1` or provision a Windows host with the required SDKs/workloads before rerunning restore/build/test/smoke.
  - 2025-10-10: Windows 10 SDK 19041+ cannot be installed in this Linux container; rerun provisioning on a Windows host with the official SDK installer.
  - Initial inventory of MAUI assets/services/modules captured; continue refining alongside future SDK-enabled verification.
  - Smoke automation is blocked until SDK + Windows tooling are installed.
- Audit inspector surfacing and smoke automation remain blocked until the SDK gap is resolved.
  - 2025-09-24: Batch 0 rerun inside container confirmed `.NET 9` CLI is still missing; all `dotnet` commands fail immediately. Remains a prerequisite before module CRUD refactors can progress.

## Notes
- 2026-02-09: MainWindowViewModel now resolves session/configuration metadata via IUserSession + DatabaseOptions and pushes the values into ShellStatusBarViewModel; new WPF unit tests instantiate the status bar control to verify EN/HR localization strings and metadata population while dotnet restore/build/test remain blocked because the CLI is unavailable in the container.

### Accessibility Verification — Locale-Sensitive Metadata
- **Verification date:** 2026-01-20
- **Tooling:** Accessibility Insights for Windows (intended) — launch blocked in the Linux-based container; no Windows desktop/Win32 UI automation channel is available to attach to the WPF shell build.
- **Scope targeted:** Fluent Ribbon (Home/View/Tools tabs), AvalonDock panes (Modules tree, document host tabs, Inspector, Status bar), and representative module document views (Dashboard, Audit, Attachments) for tooltip/name localization parity.

### Language Toggle Workflow (WPF Shell)
1. **Navigation path** — From the WPF shell ribbon choose **View ▸ Language ▸ English/Croatian** (or invoke the backstage **Settings ▸ Language** command once the menu is wired). The toggle ultimately calls `ILocalizationService.SetLanguage("en"|"hr")`.
2. **Expected behavior** — Ribbon tabs/groups, toolbar toggles, module tree headers, dock titles, and status text update immediately after the command runs. View-models (e.g., `ModuleTreeViewModel`, `B1FormDocumentViewModel`) receive the `LanguageChanged` event and refresh their localized properties before notifying bindings.
3. **Persistence + layout** — Current language is stored in the shell profile to restore on next launch; layout files include the culture token so persisted AvalonDock layouts pick the proper resource dictionary.
4. **Fallback handling** — If an unsupported locale (e.g., `fr-FR`) is requested, `LocalizationManager` normalizes the culture to `en` and keeps the UI responsive, logging the downgrade for operators. Missing keys fall back to XAML resource dictionaries (typically `Strings.xaml`) and ultimately echo the key name for diagnosis.
5. **Operational note** — When running without full resource dictionaries (design-time or test harness), expect ribbon/toolbars to display invariant English strings. Smoke harness scripts should queue a language flip (EN→HR→EN) to confirm bindings respond.
- **Follow-up / actions:** Coordinate a Windows 11 host with the .NET 9 toolchain and Accessibility Insights installed, rerun the locale-sensitive tooltip/name pass, and archive the output (captured UIA tree + screenshots) in `Diagnostics/Accessibility`. Retry is scheduled alongside the next Windows-based smoke harness execution.
