  project_overview: YasGMP centralizes GMP-compliant manufacturing maintenance, calibration,
    and quality workflows. The application spans the MAUI client, shared services,
    and diagnostics tooling that keep change control, audit trail, and validation
    data consistent across platforms.
  current_focus:
    - Complete automation around schema diff regression reports.
    - Close UI gaps between MAUI work order flows and the expanded data models.
  blockers:
    - QA sign-off on the change-control replay harness is still pending.
  next_steps:
    - Backfill calibration certificate seed data after the schema migration.
    - Schedule Android smoke testing once attachment sync stabilizes.
